Create namespaces, Role- and ClusterRoleBindings, and kubeconfig files to allow temporary namespace admin access to a Kubernetes cluster

As a user with cluster-admin level access, run the create-namespaces.sh script with two arguments, the start and end number to append to the namespace name (e.g. ./create-namespaces.sh 1 15 will create 15 namespaces named kube01 through kube15). This will also create a new ClusterRole called view-all that enables the user to get, watch, and list all resources, as well as to create, update patch, and delete prometheus resources (this is necessary to allow the user to see metrics in OpenLens). The script uses a ClusterRoleBinding to assign this ClusterRole to users whose names match the namespace names. It also uses a RoleBinding to assign the admin ClusterRole to each user, scoped to their matching namespace. This script needs only be run once on the cluster, but it can be run again to create additional namespaces and associated access permissions.

Then run the create-kubeconfigs.sh script with the same two arguments. This will create kubeconfig files for each user that expire in 48 hours. Once the kubeconfig files have been created, distribute them to users to put in their $HOME/.kube directory as a file named config (or merge it into their existing kubeconfig). Because the kubeconfig files expire after 48 hours, you will need to run this script again for users after the expiration.
